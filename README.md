# Magnetic encoder tablet

First of all a disclaimer. I did not come up with this idea myself. This project is inspired by the HYKU tablet (formerly known as the tabletless tablet).
The HYKU tablet came to my attention when it was featured on the channel of a youtuber named Koifishu. As soon as I saw that I got the idea to make one myself.
The HYKU tablet is a (community made?) product that is available for purchase so if you are interested show them some support!
(for now I have no plans to create a product and I plan to keep this a DIY project)

For people who don't know, this tablet is designed for a rythm game named osu! where you aim at circles and tap to the beat. One major reason to use the HYKU over any other drawing tablet is its high refresh rate. 

As a side note: I already took a brief look into if it is possible to somehow increase the refresh rate of regular drawing tablets, but abandoned the idea pretty early as it seems very difficult/impossible.

# My version
Of course I don't plan on copying their idea completely. One of the fist things that came to mind when I saw the HYKU tablet was the cables leading to the elbow joint, where they put one of two magnetic encoders. I think the arm configuration would be called SCARA.
I want to experiment with the idea of putting both encoders on the base and use a "twin arm SCARA" configuration.
